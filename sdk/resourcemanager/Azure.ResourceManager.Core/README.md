# Azure ResourceManager Core client library for .NET

This package follows the [new Azure SDK guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_introduction.html) which provide a number of core capabilities that are shared amongst all Azure SDKs, including the intuitive Azure Identity library, an HTTP Pipeline with custom policies, error-handling, distributed tracing, and much more.

## Getting started 

### Install the package

Install the Azure Resources management core library for .NET with [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/):

```PowerShell
Install-Package Azure.ResourceManager.Core -Version 1.0.0-beta.1
```

### Prerequisites

You will need the following values to authenticate to Azure

-   **Subscription ID**
-   **Client ID**
-   **Client Secret**
-   **Tenant ID**

The detailed instructions on how to get and set this values can be found in the [Prerequisites guide](docs/Prerequisites.md). 

### Authentication and Creating Resource Management Client

Once the environment is setup, all you need to do is to create an
authenticated client. Our default option is to use
**DefaultAzureCredential** and create an **AzureResourceManagerClient**.  Since all management APIs go through the same endpoint
you no longer need to create a new client for every resource type like before.

To authenticate to Azure and create an ARM client, simply do the
following:
```csharp
    using Azure.Identity;
    using Azure.ResourceManager.Core;
    using System;
    ...
    ArmClient armClient = new ArmClient(new DefaultAzureCredential());
```
From this code snippet, we showed that in order to interact with Resources, we need to create the top-level client first **AzureResourceManagerClient**

More information and different authentication approaches using Azure
Identity can be found in [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-dotnet).

## Key concepts
### Understanding Azure Resource Hierarchy

In order to reduce both the number of clients needed to perform common tasks and the amount of redundant parameters that each of those clients take, we have introduced an object hierarchy in the SDK that mimics the object hierarchy in Azure. Each resource client in the SDK has methods to access the resource clients of its children that is already scoped to the proper subscription and resource group.

To accomplish this we are introducing 4 standard types for all resources in Azure.
#### **[Resource]Data**
This represents the data that makes up a given resource.  Typically this is the response data from a service call such as GET and provides details about the underlying resource.
Previously this was represented by a **Model** class.

#### **[Resource]Operations**

This represents a service client that is scoped to a particular resource.
You can directly execute all operations on that client without needing to pass in scope
parameters such as subscription id or resource name.

#### **[Resource]Container**

This represents the operations you can perform on a collection of resources belonging to a specific parent resource.
This mainly consists of List or Create operations.
For most things the parent will be a **ResourceGroup**, however each parent / child relationship is represented this way.
Such as a **Subnet** is a child of a **VirtualNetwork** or a **ResourceGroup** is a child of a **Subscription**.

#### **[Resource]**

This represents a full resource object which contains a **Data** property exposing the details as a **[Resource]Data** type.
It also has access to all of the operations and like the **[Resource]Operations** object is already scoped
to a specific resource in Azure.

### Migrating from current to preview versions
There are core differences between the current and new preview SDK.
The main ones are:
- The introduction of Resource Operations.
- An structured Resource Identifier.

You can learn more about the main differences [in this document](docs\MigratingFromCurrentToPreview.md) and reading the examples below.


## Examples
### Add a tag to a virtual machine
 Imagine that our company requires all virtual machines to be tagged with the owner and we are tasked with writing a program to add the tag to any missing virtual machines in a given resource group.

 ```csharp
// First we construct our armClient
ArmClient armClient = new ArmClient(new DefaultAzureCredential());

// Next we get a resource group object
// ResourceGroup is a [Resource] object from above
ResourceGroup resourceGroup = await armClient.DefaultSubscription.GetResourceGroups().GetAsync("myRgName");

// Next we get the container for the virtual machines
// vmContainer is a [Resource]Container object from above
VirtualMachineContainer vmContainer = resourceGroup.GetVirtualMachines();

// Next we loop over all vms in the container
// Each vm is a [Resource] object from above
await foreach(VirtualMachine vm in vmContainer.ListAsync())
{
    // We access the [Resource]Data properties from vm.Data
    if(!vm.Data.Tags.ContainsKey("owner"))
    {
        // We can also access all [Resource]Operations from vm since it is already scoped for us
        await vm.StartAddTag("owner", GetOwner()).WaitForCompletionAsync();
    }
}
 ```

### Create a resource group
```csharp
// First we initialize the ArmClient and get the default subscription
ArmClient armClient = new ArmClient(new DefaultAzureCredential());
Subscription subscription = armClient.DefaultSubscription;
// Now we get a ResourceGroup container for that subscription
ResourceGroupContainer rgContainer = subscription.GetResourceGroups();

// With the container we can create a new resource group with an specifc name and location
LocationData location = LocationData.WestUS2;
string rgName = "myRgName";
ResourceGroup resourceGroup = await rgContainer.Construct(location).CreateAsync(rgName);
```

### List all resource groups
```csharp
// First we initialize the ArmClient and get the default subscription
ArmClient armClient = new ArmClient(new DefaultAzureCredential());
Subscription subscription = armClient.DefaultSubscription;

// Now we get a ResourceGroup container for that subscription
ResourceGroupContainer rgContainer = subscription.GetResourceGroups();

// With ListAsync() we can get a list of the resources in the container
AsyncPageable<ResourceGroup> response = rgContainer.ListAsync();
await foreach (ResourceGroup rg in response)
{
    Console.WriteLine(rg.Data.Name);
}
```

## Troubleshooting

-   If you find a bug or have a suggestion, file an issue via [Github
    Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues) and
    make sure you add the "Preview" label to the issue.
-   If you need help, check [previous
    questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure+.net)
    or ask new ones on StackOverflow using azure and .NET tags.
-   If having trouble with authenthication, go to [DefaultAzureCredential documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-dotnet).
