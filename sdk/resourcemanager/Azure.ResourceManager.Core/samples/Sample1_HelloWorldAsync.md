# Example: Getting a subscription

>Note: Before getting started with the samples, make sure to go trough the [prerequisites]<--(./README.md#Prerequisites)-->.

The following code shows how to get the default subscription:

```csharp
ArmClient armClient = new ArmClient(new DefaultAzureCredential());
Subscription subscription = armClient.DefaultSubscription;
Console.WriteLine(subscription.Id);
```

It is possible to get an specific subscription as it's shown next:

``` csharp
string subscriptionId = "db1ab6f0-4769-4b27-930e-01e2ef9c123c";
ArmClient armClient = new ArmClient(new DefaultAzureCredential());
Subscription subscription = armClient.GetSubscriptions().GetAsync(subscriptionId);
Console.WriteLine(subscription.Id);
```

With the `Async` keyword at the end of methods that perform API calls, it is possible to differentiate the asynchronous and synchronous variants of any method.

From here, it is possible to get the resource groups from the retrieved subscription:

```csharp
ResourceGroupContainer rgContainer = subscription.GetResourceGroups();
```
