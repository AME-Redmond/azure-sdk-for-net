# Example: Getting a susbcription

>Note: Before getting started with the samples, make sure to go trought [prerequisites guide]<---(./docs/Prerequistes.md)-->.

The following code shows how to get the default subscription:

```csharp
ArmClient armClient = new ArmClient(new DefaultAzureCredential());
Subscription subscription = armClient.DefaultSubscription;
Console.WriteLine(subscription.Id);
```

It is possible to get an specific subscription as it's shown next:

``` csharp
string subscriptionId = "db1ab6f0-4769-4b27-930e-01e2ef9c123c";
ArmClient armClient = new ArmClient(new DefaultAzureCredential());
Subscription subscription = armClient.GetSubscriptions().TryGet(subscriptionId);
Console.WriteLine("Got suscription: " + subscription.Data.DisplayName);
```

From here, it is possible to get the resource groups from the retrieved subscription:

```csharp
ResourceGroupContainer rgContainer = subscription.GetResourceGroups();
```
