# Example: Getting a subscription

>Note: Before getting started with the samples, make sure to go trough the [prerequisites](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/feature/mgmt-track2/sdk/resourcemanager/Azure.ResourceManager.Core#prerequisites).

The following code shows how to get the default subscription:

```C# Snippet:Hello_World_DefaultSubscription

```

It's possible to get a specific subscription as follows:

```C# Snippet:Hello_World_SpecificSubscription

```

From here, it is possible to get the resource groups from the retrieved subscription:

```C# Snippet:Hello_World_ResourceGroupContainer

```
